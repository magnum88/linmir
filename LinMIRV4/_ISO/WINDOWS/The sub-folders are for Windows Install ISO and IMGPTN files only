PLEASE READ!

The \_ISO\WINDOWS\XXXX folders are for WINDOWS INSTALL .ISO, .imgPTN payload files ONLY!

.imgPTN files should NOT be placed in the \_ISO\WINDOWS\XP folder.

If you have a Windows XP .imgPTN file, use one of the normal folders such as \_ISO\MAINMENU or \_ISO\WIN.


Do not put .MNU files or any other type of file in these folders.

If you have a custom ALL-IN-ONE Windows Install ISO, you will probably need to convert it to a .imgPTN file to get it to work.

You can change the name of .key and .xml files if you wish (e.g. for a different language).
